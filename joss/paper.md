# Summary

_exoplanet_ is a toolkit for probabilistic modeling of time series data in
astronomy with a focus on observations of exoplanets, using _PyMC3_ [@pymc3].
PyMC3 is a flexible and high-performance model building language and inference
engine that scales well to problems with a large number of parameters.
_exoplanet_ extends _PyMC3_â€™s modeling language to support many of the custom
functions and distributions required when fitting exoplanet datasets or other
exoplanet time series. Besides the primary `exoplanet` package, the _exoplanet_
ecosystem of projects includes:

- `exoplanet-core`[^exoplanet-core], which includes efficient and well-tested
  compiled implementations of all of the exoplanet-specific operations required
  by the exoplanet package;
- `celerite2`[^celerite2], an updated implementation of the _celerite_
  algorithm[^celerite] [@foremanmackey17, @foremanmackey18] for scalable
  Gaussian Process regression for time series data;
- `pymc3-ext`[^pymc3-ext], a set of helper functions to make _PyMC3_ more
  amenable to the standard astronomical workflow; and
- `rebound-pymc3`[^rebound-pymc3], an interface between _rebound_ [@rein12] and
  _PyMC3_ to enable inference with full N-body orbit integration.
